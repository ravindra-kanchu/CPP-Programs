/* 
   * resuability is a very important feature of oops
   * in c++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
   * reusing classes saves time and money
   * reusing already tested and debugging class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugged class will
         the same thing again.

/*
    1.the concept of resualibilty in c++ is supported by using inheritance
    2.we can reuse the poperties of an exisiting class by inheriting from it
    3. the existing class is called as the //Base class
    4.the new class which is inherited is called as the //Derived class
    5.reusing classes saves time and money
    6.there are different types os inheri in c++


    // 1.multiple
    // 2.hierarchical
    // 3.multilevel
    // 4.hybird

*/

// in single inheritance  a derived class with only one base class
// in multiple a derived class with more than one base class  ( a,b to c)
// in hierarchical several derived classes from a single base class ( c to b,c)
// in multilevel deriving a class from already derived class ( a to b to c)
// in hybird is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inher
     // a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance
     // however,one of the parent classes is not a base class
